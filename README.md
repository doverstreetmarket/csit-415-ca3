## Changes from Previous Version:
- Added functions for multiplication and division to enable more comprehensive arithmetic operations.
- Updated the main function to calculate and display the product and quotient in addition to the sum and difference.
- Changed function names add and subtract to addition and subtraction.
- Edited program description to match with changes made.

## Program Description:
This JavaScript program performs basic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, on two predefined numbers. It showcases the usage of functions to encapsulate these operations and prints the results to the console.

## Functions:
- `multiplication(a, b)`: Returns the product of two numbers.
- `addition(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
- `division(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of two numbers, handling division by zero cases.
- `subtraction(a, b)`: Returns the difference of two numbers.

## How to Execute:
To run this program, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/doverstreetmarket/csit-415-ca3.git`
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files.
3. Open the file `numbers.js` in the IDE of your choice.
4. Execute the program by entering `node numbers.js` in your terminal.

## Example Output:
Upon executing the program, you should see output similar to the following in your console:

```
The numbers used for 'a' are 10 and for 'b' are 8.
The sum of 10 and 8 is 18.
The difference of 10 and 8 is 2.
The product of 10 and 8 is 80.
The quotient of 10 and 8 is 1.25.
```
